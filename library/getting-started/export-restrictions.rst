Background
----------
The #SNMP Library is open source software that contains strong encryption. Specifically, it has the ability to encrypt and decrypt SNMPv3 protocol. Its primary distribution point is 
in the United States, and subsequently falls under U.S. encryption export regulations.

To the best of our knowledge, #SNMP Library falls under ECCN 5D002 and qualifies for license exemption TSU under Section 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR. There are no U.S. regulations that 
prohibit you from downloading #SNMP Library.

Frank Hecker has written `a detailed explanation of Mozilla's ECCN <http://hecker.org/mozilla/eccn>`_ . It applies to other open source software, including #SNMP Library.

Addendum: Prior to January 7, 2011, downloading #SNMP Library in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, and Syria was prohibited.
