Export Restrictions
===================

By `Lex Li`_

This page shows you information about export restrictions.

Background
----------
The C# SNMP Library is open source software that contains strong encryption.
Specifically, it has the ability to encrypt and decrypt SNMPv3 protocol. Its
primary distribution point is in the United States, and subsequently falls
under U.S. encryption export regulations.

To the best of our knowledge, C# SNMP Library falls under ECCN 5D002 and
qualifies for license exemption TSU under Section 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR. There
are no U.S. regulations that prohibit you from downloading C# SNMP Library.

Frank Hecker has written `a detailed explanation of Mozilla's ECCN

including C# SNMP Library.

Addendum: Prior to January 7, 2011, downloading C# SNMP Library in Cuba, Iran,
North Korea, Libya, Sudan, and Syria was prohibited. `On January 7, 2011 the
U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security removed this restriction
