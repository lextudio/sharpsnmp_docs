Background
----------
MIB documents can be found from SNMP RFC documents, product manuals, and
Internet downloads. So why do they exist and do I need them? The answer varies
for each roles you play.

Device Vendors
--------------
If you are going to sell an SNMP enabled device, you need to prepare user
manuals and also provide the MIB documents to your customers. Your developers
have implemented management objects in the agent software, which is invisible
to everyone else.

The customers can only learn how to manage the device via the MIB documents
you provide.

Device Administrators
---------------------
If you bought an SNMP enabled device from a vendor, make sure you grab the MIB
documents and learn carefully which objects are exposed.

You can import the MIB documents to a monitor software, or write your own
software to monitor the objects.

SNMP OID, Data Type, and Description
------------------------------------
From the MIB documents you know the identifiers (OID) of the management
objects, their data types, and descriptions. That information can then be put
down to papers.

You can use #SNMP Library with MIB documents, as only OID is required during
request construction in most cases. Of course data type is needed when
performing SET operations. The descriptions help you understand the meaning of
the data you get from the agent.
