C# SNMP Release Notes
=====================

This page documents major releases of C# SNMP Library.

Releases
--------
Detailed release notes have been moved and can be found at
`GitHub <https://github.com/lextudio/sharpsnmplib/releases>`_ .

Product Lifecycle
-----------------
Due to the introduction of #SNMP Pro products, the support lifecycle will match
the corresponding Pro products.

#SNMP Pro releases (2.0.0 and 2.1.0) requires C# SNMP Library 10.0.2 and above,
so release 10.0.2 and above are all supported.

Any release older than 10.0.2 is obsolete and no longer supported.

Please visit `#SNMP Pro page <https://pro.sharpsnmp.com/support/release-notes.html>`_ to learn more.
