Licensing Terms
===============

This page shows you how the licensing works for the Pro Edition. 

Licensing Model for C# SNMP Pro MIB Library
-------------------------------------------
When purchasing a license for the C# SNMP Pro MIB Library, you receive a licensed copy for one developer and unlimited number of redistributable run-time licenses.

This means that one software developer can install the licensed version of the C# SNMP Pro MIB Library to his or her computer. The redistributable run-time licenses can be deployed in the development 
environment in order to test and debug the product through its development stages. After the product is fully developed, the redistributable run-time licenses can be deployed (bundled with your 
application) either within your company (i.e., if you were developing an in-house tool) and/or sold to your end users (again, bundled with your application). You are eligible to redistribute unlimited 
copies of C# SNMP Pro MIB Library.

Evaluation License for C# SNMP Pro MIB Library
------------------------------------------------
C# SNMP Pro MIB Library is available for a 15-day evaluation, so that potential customers may try using the software before ordering the regular software licenses. Under the 15-day evaluation license the user 
should determine the suitability of the evaluated software product, its available functions, performance capabilities and similar features. Under the 15-day evaluation license the user is not permitted 
to use the evaluated product for any kind of commercial purposes. More specifically, with the product running under the evaluation license it is not permitted to test or debug equipment for commercial 
purposes, it is not permitted to provide commercial training services, nor any similar commercial activity. Such activities can be performed only after obtaining the licensed version of the software.

If the user determines the suitability of the evaluated software product, the regular software license should be obtained. Otherwise, the user must uninstall and stop using the evaluation software.
