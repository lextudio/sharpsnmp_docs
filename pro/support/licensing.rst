Licensing Model for #SNMP MIB Compiler Pro
------------------------------------------
Lex Li issues a unique license file for each ordered software license. The user then applies the license file to the installed software. Once the software license is applied, the licensed software 
product displays 'Registered' in title. Each license entitles the user to install and use the licensed software on only one computer, i.e., each license file can be applied to at most one copy of 
the installed software.

Floating license is not supported. Due to the nature of the software, the software does not contain any functions for floating license checking. Many users install the software on their laptops and 
then use it somewhere in the field. It might be inconvenient for them if the software was trying to connect to some kind of licensing server in order to determine if it is eligible to start-up or 
not, depending on the current number of other users.

Without signing an appropriate software licensing agreement with Lex Li it is not permitted to bundle any purchased products and license files with your products and ship them to your customers or end-users. 

The MIB documents authored or the C# source files generated are the intellectual properties of the licensees and Lex Li does not request any permission on them. 

Evaluation License for #SNMP MIB Compiler Pro
---------------------------------------------
#SNMP MIB Compiler Pro is available for a 15-day evaluation, so that potential customers may try using the software before ordering the regular software licenses. Under the 15-day evaluation license 
the user should determine the suitability of the evaluated software product, its available functions, performance capabilities and similar features. Under the 15-day evaluation license the user is 
not permitted to use the evaluated product for any kind of commercial purposes. More specifically, with the product running under the evaluation license it is not permitted to test or debug equipment 
for commercial purposes, it is not permitted to provide commercial training services, nor any similar commercial activity. Such activities can be performed only after obtaining the licensed version of 
the software.

If the user determines the suitability of the evaluated software product, the regular software license should be obtained. Otherwise, the user must uninstall and stop using the evaluation software.

Licensing Model for SharpSnmpPro.Mib Assembly
---------------------------------------------
When purchasing a license for the SharpSnmpPro.Mib Assembly, you receive a license for one developer and unlimited number of redistributable run-time licenses.

This means that one software developer can install the licensed version of the SharpSnmpPro.Mib Assembly to his or her computer. The redistributable run-time licenses can be deployed in the development 
environment in order to test and debug the product through its development stages. After the product is fully developed, the redistributable run-time licenses can be deployed (bundled with your 
application) either within your company (i.e., if you were developing an in-house tool) and/or sold to your end users (again, bundled with your application). You are eligible to redistribute unlimited 
copies of SharpSnmpPro.Mib Assembly.
