Bundled Three-Month Email Support
=================================

This page clarifies the complimentary three (3) months of email based support
included with every valid purchase of the **#SNMP Pro Bundle**.

.. important:: This bundled support benefit **does NOT cover the open-source
   C# SNMP Library** (sometimes referred to as "C# SNMP" or "Library"). It only
   applies to the commercial #SNMP Pro components (Pro MIB Library and the
   compiler tools) delivered as part of your purchase. For the C# SNMP Library
   or broader production assistance, you must use or purchase a separate
   commercial support contract (see `Professional Support Contracts
   <https://support.lextudio.com/contracts/purchase.html>`_).

Overview
--------
The bundled support is a lightweight, best-effort email assistance channel to
help you successfully install, activate, and begin using #SNMP Pro components.
It is intentionally limited in scope and is **not** a substitute for the paid
Professional Support or Advisory Services offerings.

Activation & Term
-----------------
* Starts: The calendar day the delivery email containing the product download
  or access instructions is sent ("Delivery Date").
* Duration: 90 consecutive calendar days ("Bundled Support Period").
* Expiry: Access automatically ends at 23:59 (Delivery Date + 90 days) in the
  Eastern Time Zone.
* No pauses or extensions (except where required by applicable law).

How to Use
----------
Send your questions from the email address used for purchase to
``support@lextudio.com``. Include:

1. Order reference or proof of purchase.
2. Product version (compiler and/or MIB Library build number).
3. A concise description of the issue, reproduction steps, and expected vs.
   actual behavior.

Scope of Assistance
-------------------
Typical in-scope topics:

* Installation and activation issues.
* Basic configuration and usage questions of shipped features.
* Clarification of documented behaviors.
* Defect triage (confirmation whether behavior is a known issue or by design).

Response Targets (Non-SLA)
--------------------------
We aim (but do not contractually commit) to first responses **within 2
business days** during normal business hours (10:00–19:00 Eastern, Monday–
Friday, excluding public holidays). Follow-up cadence depends on complexity
and available diagnostic information.

Exclusions
----------
The bundled support does **not** include:

* Assistance with the open-source C# SNMP Library (bug triage, how-to, patches).
* Priority queuing, guaranteed SLAs, or after-hours/weekend coverage.
* Custom development, architecture or performance tuning guidance.
* Deep protocol analysis beyond confirming decoder/encoder behavior.
* Source code review of your applications.
* Onsite or remote screen-sharing sessions (unless explicitly invited for
  faster triage, at our discretion).
* Migration planning between major releases or refactoring strategies.
* Security audits or penetration testing.

Not Covered: C# SNMP Library
----------------------------
The open-source C# SNMP Library is supported by the community on a best-effort
basis. The bundled #SNMP Pro support does not entitle you to:

* Accelerated fixes in the Library.
* Private patches or backports.
* Formal incident handling for Library-related production outages.

If you require those services, consider purchasing Professional Support or
Advisory Services (see `Support Services <https://support.lextudio.com>`_).

Upgrade / Extension Path
------------------------
If your needs expand (for example: production incident debugging, performance
profiling, architectural reviews, or continued assistance after the Bundled
Support Period), you should purchase:

* Professional Support Incident(s) or 5-Pack Annual Contract; or
* Professional Advisory Services.

See :doc:`/support/purchase` and external `Support Contracts
<https://support.lextudio.com/contracts/purchase.html>`_.

End of Period
-------------
After expiry, new inquiries will be asked to transition to a paid support
channel. Previously provided guidance remains under the disclaimers below.

Data & Privacy
--------------
Diagnostic information you share (logs, snippets, crash traces) is used only
to reproduce and analyze reported issues. Do not send secrets, credentials, or
personal data; redact before submission whenever possible.

Relationship to Service Agreement
---------------------------------
This page refines the scope of the complimentary benefit. All other terms
(limitations of liability, acceptable use, refund terms) follow the broader
Customer Support Service Agreement where applicable.
