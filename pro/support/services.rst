Professional Support Services
-----------------------------
Professional Support helps you address problems encountered with the development, deployment and management of #SNMP products (#SNMP Library, its samples, and Pro Edition) in business environments.

Professional Support is available as a single “pay-per-incident” (PPI) or an annual contract with five incidents. Professional Support incidents focus on troubleshooting a specific problem, error message, or functionality that is not working as intended for #SNMP products. An incident is defined as a single support issue and the reasonable effort to resolve it. Incidents may be submitted online. Response time will be between 2 and 8 hours, depending on severity of incident.

Advisory Services
-----------------
Professional Advisory services are designed for developers, IT professionals and small and medium business customers to provide advice and information to enable customers to deliver their own solution, e.g. providing recommendations and best practices for design, development and deployment, leveraging #SNMP products and technologies.

Professional Advisory services are provided for the same price as a Professional Support incident, and the delivery time is expected be similar to a support incident, typically 2 to 3 hours. Requests may be rescoped to fit the limited delivery time or the service may be declined. Professional Advisory services are available during normal business hours: 7:00 PM – 10:00 PM Eastern Time Zone Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays. Response time will be 8 hours. Simply contact `the support team`_ , stating that you want Professional Advisory Services.
