MIB-to-C# Compilation
=====================

This page shows you information about how to enable MIB-to-C# compilation.

Background
----------
C# SNMP Library has a sample project that can work as a test agent. The agent can
be manually extended to support more management objects, but it is possible to
compile MIB documents to C# classes so as to simplify the process.

Evaluation Steps
----------------

Generating C# Source files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: TODO. Please contact support if you need help with the steps.

.. warning: This GitHub repo does not work with the Trial edition of `SharpSnmpPro.Mib`.

Extending Test Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: TODO. Please contact support if you need help with the steps.

Limitations
-----------
This article is provided as it is, and the goal is to show what extra features
are possible to be implemented based on #SNMP Pro.

There is no break-fix support to use either the test agent or the generated C#
classes for production usage, but we sell consulting services if you need some
specific assistance with your project.
